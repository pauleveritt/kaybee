Resources
=========

Resources are the heart of Kaybee. They allow a Sphinx page to become a unit
of knowledge which can be listed, queried, and referenced. You simply embed
some YAML into a document to turn it into a resource. If you provide a bad
value, an associated schema will tell you.

You can use the built-in resource, make your own kinds of resources, or use
Kaybee extensions that provide ready-to-go systems of resource types and
related parts such as widgets.
