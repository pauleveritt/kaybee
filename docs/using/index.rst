============
Using Kaybee
============

It's January 2018. For a year, I've experimented with this idea. Wrote stuff,
threw it out, started over. Went down wrong directions, started over. Got
to the point where it was working ok, then...threw everything out, started
over.

The last major missing piece is now done. And I get to talk about *using*
Kaybee. It's exciting. Let's show some of Kaybee in action.
