Extending Kaybee
================

Out-of-the box, Kaybee provides a number of useful features. Also, others can
provide a "box": plugins which provide you with new kinds of things to
use in your documents.

But perhaps you'd like to extend Kaybee yourself, either inline in a docs
project or as Python packages that get installed.

This section covers aspects of extending Kaybee.

TODO
- Document using livereload, PyCharm and avoiding the sphinx run config
- debugdumper
- Start with templates
