# Now

- Write integration test for resource returning test.html

- Figure out integration test for Sphinx raising exceptions

- Write tests for what was just added

- Get html context event to return the template name

- Get rid of resources.resource and just mark BaseResource

- Integration bumpcoverage

# Next

- Get kaybee_settings into the html context as ``settings``

- Purge resources events (but document that it probably won't be used)

- extract_title plugin

    - Docs
    
    - Put into html context

- genericpage replacement

# Could Be Better

- Move excerpt support to article

- Update documentation

    - Re-organizing "Using" to be plugin-based

- Resources: Allow resources to override the template directory registration 
  by making the function read a value returned from the resource type 
  class

# Done

- Integration test coverage
