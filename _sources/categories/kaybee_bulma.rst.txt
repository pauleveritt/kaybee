============

`kaybee_bulma <https://github.com/pauleveritt/kaybee_bulma>`_
is a :ref:`Bulma-based <category-bulma>` theme for Kaybee's
:doc:`article system <../articles/index>`.

The theme is designed as a very modern alternative to the Sphinx theming
template structure. It shares no HTML/Jinja2/CSS with any of Sphinx (and
one day, no JS.) The theme instead is done like a modern web frontend.

This documentation uses ``kaybee_bulma``.
